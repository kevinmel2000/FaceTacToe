#FaceTacToe
======================

##Android workshop at Les Gobelins school 

* Tic Tac Toe Game written in Java for Android smartphone and tablet
* Basic Artificial Intelligence with three levels :
- easy : randomly fill the grid,
- medium : randomly choose to randomly fill the grid or try to win and stop the player,
- hard : try to win and stop the player,
* Use of OpenGL ES and particle effect thanks to the library AndEngine (the use of OpenGL in such a game is not really justified, this is just a personal goal to see how to develop OpenGL ES applications in Java for Android)
* Send SMS and Email
* Use custom picture from the camera of the device library

Note that this project will not properly work in the Android Emulator since OpenGL ES is not fully supported as Google said :
"Caution: As of SDK Tools Revision 17, the graphics acceleration feature for the emulator is experimental; be alert for incompatibilities and errors when using this feature." (http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html)
