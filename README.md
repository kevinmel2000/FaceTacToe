#FaceTacToe
======================

##Android workshop at Les Gobelins school 

* Tic Tac Toe Game written in Java for Android smartphone and tablet

* Basic Artificial Intelligence with three levels :
	* Easy : randomly fill the grid.
	* Medium : randomly choose to randomly fill the grid or try to win and stop the player.
	* Hard : try to win and stop the player.

* Use of OpenGL ES and particle effect thanks to the library AndEngine. (The use of OpenGL in such a game is not really justified, this is just a personal goal to see how to develop OpenGL ES applications in Java for Android.)

* Use custom picture from the camera or the device library.

* Send SMS and Email.

Note that this project will not properly work in the Android Emulator since OpenGL ES is not fully supported as Google said :
"Caution: As of SDK Tools Revision 17, the graphics acceleration feature for the emulator is experimental; be alert for incompatibilities and errors when using this feature." (http://developer.android.com/tools/devices/emulator.html)
